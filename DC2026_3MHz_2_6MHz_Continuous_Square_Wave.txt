//3MHz to 2.6MHz Square Wave Loop
//Test loop to confirm all the R2R latches work and test the speeds
//We found that when we have PORTB turned on outside the loop, and use the while(1) loop, we can get a 
//2.6MHz wave with PORT C and PORT D on/off, with a 33% positive duty cycle
//This hits all quadrants. When we turn off either portC or portD, we can reach 3MHz with a 25% positive duty cycle
